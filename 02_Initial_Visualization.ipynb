    "The partial discharge training dataset is 8712 recordings of voltage fluctuations along \"medium voltage\" transmission lines in Czech Republic. Medium and high voltage transmission lines transport electrical engineering in a \"3-phase\" or tri-phasic configuration. This means that one can think of there being 4 power lines in total: a neutral / common wire as well as 3 energized lines transporting alternating current (AC) alternating between approximately positive and negative 20,000 Volts (+/- 20KV) at rate of 50 Hertz (Hz). An ideal represenation would be 3 sinusoids out of phase by 120 degrees as represented below. 50 Hertz corresponds with a oscillation of 50 times per second, or a periodicity of 1 / 50 sec^-1 = 20 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time series signal is a one-dimensional array of 800,000 samples of one period of the all three wire phases. Therefore, 20 miliseconds / 800,000 samples gives a sampling period of 25 nanoseconds or 40 MHz."

    "Partial discharge can be thought of as alocalized breakdown occuring from within a single wire. This can be due to lacunas (voids) within the insulating material or even in the insulating oil of transformers.\n",
    " \n",
    " In contrast to coronal arcing, which occurs between two or more wires and is visual to the eye at a distance, partial discharge remians unseen and must be determined by localized measurement. Protracted partial discharge inevitably lead to a full discharge event (short circuit) due to insulator breakdown. The resultant short circuit often leads to catestrophic component loss, and prezents a sigificant hazard to person and property.\n",
    " \n",
    "All medium and high voltage transmission lines are suscpetible to heightened likelihood of partial discharge due to mishandling of transmission lines, bith at time of installation as well as after a time in the field. Even so, all lines ultimately are assumed to be at risk due to the increased stress generated by a large electromagnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large body of academic literature discusses better ways to detect and predict partial discharge. Better modeling in turn leads to ease by which all segments of the electrical transmission grid can move towards inxepensive conitinuous monitoring."

    "Each time series signal is a one-dimensional array of 800,000 samples of one period for each  wire phase. Therefore, 20 miliseconds divided by 800,000 samples gives a sampling period of 25 nanoseconds or 40 MHz.\n",

They have a corresponding \"phase\" of 0, 1, or 2. So for 8,712 measurements every group of 3 represnets 2,904 unique locations. Finally, the \"target\" value of 0 or 1 indicates a partial discharge failure when equal to 1.\n",

    "This pattern follows for all 8712 signals. For instance, \"signal_id\" = 90, 91, and 92 correspond to the shared \"measurement_id\" of 30, but again use \"phase\" of 0, 1, or 2."
